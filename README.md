Rupaye

Rupaye is a personal finance tracking mobile application conceptualized, designed, and developed in 2017. Born out of a personal need and observations from peers, Rupaye aimed to solve one core problem: giving first-time earners and students an easy way to track daily expenses without needing internet or financial expertise.
